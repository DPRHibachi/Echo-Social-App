# Echo - Where emotions echo through strangers (Made with love by claude :> )

Echo is a minimalist, Twitter-like platform where users can express their thoughts and feelings anonymously. The platform focuses on genuine emotional expression without the pressure of social identity.

## 🌟 Features

- **Anonymous IDs**: Every user has a random Echo ID (e.g., Echo9213) that can rotate weekly
- **Mystery Friends**: Add friends using invite codes while maintaining anonymity
- **Echo Posts**: Share short updates with mood tags and custom backgrounds
- **Private Vibes**: Keep a private journal or share thoughts to your echo feed
- **Mood Feed**: Filter and view posts based on emotional tags
